# Neighborhood Map

Using an organizational JavaScript framework and the Google Map's API, the application displays a map of Los Angeles with map markers on some popular locations. Features include: search filtering that dynamically updates the view in real time, response to clicks on the markers or on a location in the list, and some additional information drawn from the Yelp API.
